# NAVERA
NAVERA is a ransomware coded entirely in python, which fictitiously blocks your folders and files, however, this script is made so that the only way to close the script is to close the console attached to it, otherwise it is impossible to close it.

# INFORMATIONS

NAVERA blocks commands like Alt F4 or other commands and prevents you from opening CMD, Task Manager, and any other software used to close a program. The Python code is hidden to prevent it from being stolen. Nothing is done directly to your computer, everything is fictitious.

The language of this program is French, because I'm French.

The Morse folder plays a Morse code sound in the background, which says "HACKED BY NAVERA" over and over again.

I created this script to show you that Python is not a skid-proof language, and that if used properly, it could be much more powerful than viruses in C# or C++.
